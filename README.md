# Pixel-Quest
Pixel Quest is a 2D pixel-style arcade platformer built in C++ using the OneLoneCoder PixelGameEngine, combining classic retro mechanics with an evolving story-driven adventure. Players journey across two unique worlds, each featuring distinct environments, hazards, and escalating challenges that test precision, timing, and skill. What begins as a simple platforming quest gradually unfolds into a deeper narrative, where mysterious forces have destabilized the worlds, warping gravity and corrupting the terrain. With 20 carefully designed levels and more continuously being added through updates — the game steadily increases in difficulty, introducing new traps, enemy behaviors, and environmental mechanics. A built-in login and save system tracks player progress and ensures levels must be completed to unlock the next, creating a structured and rewarding progression system. Featuring smooth camera movement, particle effects, polished pixel visuals, and tight movement controls, Pixel Quest delivers both nostalgic arcade challenge and an expanding universe that continues to grow with every update.
